This project was to showcase usage of known and unknown API's as well as working within a team. 
This project changed topics as API usage was blocked but obstacles were overcame.

My team members were Clayton Seastrand and Robert Stuart


                                            Original Project ReadMe

    Who is your target audience?   People looking to rent a car, travelers
    What is the problem that the product will address? Allowing user to search across all car rentals for best deal
    What is the primary goal of the product? give user the best deal possible on renting a car anytime a rental is required.
    Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?

    As a user I would like to be able to compare rental rates on cars, availability(model, date), closest to my location, and availabilty of provided insurance.

    Remember, your MVP should be the absolute minimum product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.
    
    As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:
    
    As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
    As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of Images.
    As a user, I want to be able to view other people's Images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives.
    Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should not be part of the MVP
